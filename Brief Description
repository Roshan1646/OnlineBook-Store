Project Overview:
The Online Bookstore Database project is designed to create a robust and efficient database system for managing the inventory, customers, orders, and other crucial data of an online bookstore. 
The database aims to streamline operations, provide insights into sales performance, and facilitate an organized and effective platform for both customers and administrators.

Key Objectives:
Efficient Book Management:

Create a comprehensive database to store detailed information about each book, including title, genre, author, price, publication date, and inventory status.
Author and Customer Tracking:

Implement tables to track information about authors, such as their names, birthdates, and nationalities.
Maintain customer records, including names, email addresses, and contact numbers.
Order Processing:

Develop a system for processing customer orders, recording order details, and calculating total order amounts.
Inventory Management:

Monitor and manage the bookstore's inventory, tracking the quantity of each book in stock.
Data Relationships:

Establish relationships between tables to ensure data integrity, with foreign key constraints connecting books to authors and inventory.
Performance Analysis:

Enable administrators to analyze sales performance by identifying top-selling books, revenue contributors, and profitable markets.
